So the first thing that happens is that your browser looks up in its cache to see if that website was visited before and the IP address is known. If it can't find the IP address for the URL requested then it asks your operating system to locate the web site. The first place your operating system is going to check for the address of the URL you specified is in the hosts file (/etc/hosts in Linux and Mac, c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts in Windows). If the URL is not found inside this file, then the OS will make a DNS request to find the IP Address of the web page. The first step is to ask the Resolver (or Internet Service Provider) server to look up in its cache to see if it knows the IP Address, if the Resolver does not know then it asks the root server to ask the .COM TLD (Top Level Domain) server - if your URL ends in .net then the TLD server would be .NET and so on - the TLD server will again check in its cache to see if the requested IP Address is there. If not, then it will have at least one of the authoritative name servers associated with that URL, and after going to the Name Server, it will return the IP Address associated with your URL. 

In conclusion, the act of typing www.google.com initiates a voyage through the intricate web of protocols, systems, and servers that collectively deliver the desired webpage to the user's device. From DNS resolution to TCP connection establishment, HTTP request and response, and finally, the rendering of the webpage â€“ each step plays a crucial role in ensuring a seamless user experience. The next time you type www.google.com, take a moment to appreciate the silent symphony of technology working tirelessly to bring the digital world to your fingertips.
